1. Localization + Classification.
2. Sliding window for detecting objects all over the image.(Size of the ppatch depends on the size of the image.).
3. Activation Map for detecting objects and classes.
4. YOLO  : Choose the ground truth of each classes properly.
5. Centre block or the grid cell that lies on centre of the object, is responsible for detecting the object.
6. YOLO v1 : 1000 classes.
7. It treats the image as a single regression problem.
8. Five outputs : X, Y, W, H, Confidence.
9. Confidence = Pr(Object) * IOU.
10.IOU : Intersection over Union.
11.IOU tends to be within 0 and 1. It depends ont he overlapping of the images.
12.Non-max supression algorithm

16.Objects with the Same center point on the image, Only object can be detected. Changing the size of the sliding window would help to certain level.
