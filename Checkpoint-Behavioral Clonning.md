1.Localization + Classification
2.Sliding window for detecting objects all over the image.(Size of the ppatch depends on the size of the image.)
3.Activation Map for detecting objects and classes
4.YOLO  : Choose the ground truth of each classes properly.
5.Centre block or the grid cell that lies on centre of the object, is responsible for detecting the object.
6. YOLO v1 : 1000 classes
7.It treats the image as a single regression problem.
8.Five outputs : X, Y, W, H, Confidence.
9. Confidence = Pr(Object) * IOU
10. IOU : Intersection over Union.
11. IOU tends to be within 0 and 1. It depends ont he overlapping of the images.
